# Data Types and Variables

**Variables** represent values that are stored in memory by the computer. They can store different kinds of **Data Types** which include things such as Integers, Floats, Strings, Pointers etc.

Variables are named for the purpose of abstraction: Allowing code to be readable and managed in high-level terms. (Keeping track of variables and changing/referencing them in the future)

**Expressions** are anything that produces/returns a value (regardless of data type)
* Commonly used to return booleans during conditionals

**Assignment operators** bind variables and values: assigning values to a variable: commonly "=" in most languages  

    int a = 1000;

Assigning variables in python:

    a = 1000
    # Sets a to an int value of 1000

Only use valid characters(A to Z, underscore and 0 to 9 (except for first character))

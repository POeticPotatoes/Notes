# Introduction to Sustainability

* Why it has gained traction in recent years
    * Global Warming, Sea Level Rise, Extreme Weather increasingly common

UN Goals
* SDGs adopted in 2015, established to
    1. End Poverty
    2. Protect Planet
    3. Promote peace & prosperity
        * Acknowledging that actions will affect outcomes in other areas
        * Balancing development with social, environmental, economic sustainability
* Wicked Problems (NP-Hard)
    * Involve a range of unique but interconnected problems

Approaches to a complex problem
* Multidisciplinary (Additive knowledge of different disciplines)
* Interdisciplinary (Integration of different disciplines)
* Transdisciplinary (Across, between, beyond disciplines)

## Types of Sustainability
### Societal Sustainability
* Environmental justice/ unequal distribution of effects
* Understanding human behaviour
* Risk of political conflict/ humanitarian crises

### Economic Sustainability
* Sustainability accountants for sustainable capital investments
* Integration of financial decision
* Potential of social & environmental impact on profits
* Effect on valuation, investment

#### Circular Economy
1. Eliminate
2. Circulate
3. Regeneratre

### Environmental Perspective
* Laws of nature that govern climate change/ environmental degradation
* Intrinsic value of nature
* Human dependence on natural resources
* Natural solutions, tree planting

# Poverty, Social Inclusion, Equality
## SDG 1: No poverty 

Definition of Poverty
* International Poverty Line: costs of basic food, clothing, healthcare, shelter in low-income countries (factor in cost of human dignity)
* Purchasing Power Parity estimates (different from exchange rate)
* Average of 15 National Poverty Lines
* 1.90/day, absolute poverty line 2011
* Now 2.15/day, 2017

### Trends in Poverty
* Poverty rate has been **decreasing (30-16%)**
* Covid19 pushed 110m back into extreme poverty
* Goal: 3% by 2030
* Main regions: Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia
* Africa: GDP growth < Population Growth

### Solutions for Poverty
* Farm productivity (fertilizer for soil refilling, equipment)
* Urban productivity
* National infrastructure
* Human capital investment (Education)
* Decreasing Africa's fertility rate

#### Official Development Assistance (ODA)
* Acquisition of funds to support economic development/ welfare from high-income countries
* Possibly corrupts governments and slows growth
* Project-based approaches are optimal
* Public health aid
* Observe types of projects to decide which to discard

## Social Inclusion
SDGS:
* 3: Good Health/ Wellbeing
* 4: Quality Education
* 5: Gender Equality
* 10: Reduce Inequality
* 11: Sustainable cities/ communities
* 16: Peace, justice, strong institutions

### Income Equality
* Gini coefficient (0: Perfect equality, 1: Perfect inequality)
    * Does not show overal wealth of country, QOL or wellbeing
* Reasons for income inequality
    * Gender, Race discrimination
    * Educational inequality
    * Rich people influence politics
    * Advanced countries fail to redistribute wealth effectively

#### Solutions for Income Equality
* Time-bound goals
* Policies to estabilsh social mobility
* Tax increases on rich bois
* Training, education for idiots

### Gender Inequality
* Earning Ratio vs Employment Ratio
* Domestic inequality (unpaid care work)
* Job vulnerability 

#### Measurement
* Gender Inequality Index (GII) maternal mortaility rate, adolescent fertility rate, empowerment, labour force participation
* Gender Development Index (GDI) measures inequalities in **achievmeent** in health, education, income

# Food Security
SDG 2: Zero hunger
Goals
* Feeding 10b
* Eradicating hunger
* Health
* Economic growth
* Securing jobs
* Saving planet

2.3b people worldwide are STARVING (This is INCREASING)
* Agriculture must increase 70% by 2050

Food Security: All people at all times have physical/ economic access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food meeting dietary needs & food **preferences** for active/ healthy life.
1. Stability
4. Accessibility
3. Availability
2. Utilisation

## Agri-Food Industry
* Half of global workforce
* Responsible for 1/4 of greenhouse emissions
* Fucks up natural environment
    * Largest cause of biodiversity loss
    * Use of freshwater
    * Loading of nutrients
    * Pollution
    * Soil erosion, degradation
* Social injustices between actors in the chain
* Must support 2b more than today in <30y

## Singapore's Solution
* Diversify import supply
* Boost local production (30% by 2030)
* Allow local companies to expand overseas

# Water Scarcity
SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation (also explicitly mentioned in 3, 11, 12, 15)
* ~15 Countries face baseline water stress
* ~40 Countries face high level stress
* 1/4 baseline water stress
* Exacerbated by need for water for irrigation
* Purchase of water without pipes is costly (promotes inequality)
* Contributes to political tensions due to lack of communication

## Solutions
* World Bank suggests water be treated as economic good
    * Market-Driven Pricing
    * Volumetric Charges
    * Treatable water rights
* This lecturer bro is cfm using chatgpt holy shit fucking disgusting
    * His videos are so bad too
* Water Security Framework (8 components) to address water scarcity

### Singapore's Innovation/ Investment
* Rainfall + Sea/ Industry sources
* 17 Resevoirs
* Catchment areas development (2/3 of land)
* Marina barrage
* 85% of future demand
* 4 National Taps
    * Catchment
    * Imported
    * NEWater (Weather independent, half cost of desalination)
         * Works through deep tunnel sewage system (DTSS)
    * Desalinated via reverse osmosis (Weather independent, Most energy intensive)
* Personal water saving (Promoted by water tax, information for consumers)

can bro speak in full sentences instead of 3 words at a time

actual dogshit lecturer

# Energy and Climate Change
* Economy and Population is growing (9b by 2040)
    * Income disparity tho
    * Expense of environment
    * CO2 parts per million (ppm) increasing
* Global Warming => extreme weather frequency, severity
    * Happens across all countries
    * Impacts might be mitigated better if rich
 
Greenhouse Gas facts
* Greenhouse Gas Measurement
    1. Concentration
    2. Lifetime
    3. Global warming potential
* Main factors: 
    1. Electricity/ Heat generation
    2. Transport
* Try to limit change to <1.5 degrees

## Problems
* Using rational agent theory, difficult to measure long-term impacts
    * Probability
    * Measure of suffering
    * Of course, result is still cooked (Just how cooked)
* Countries push blame
    * China & US (India is low per capita)
    * Developing countries argue for raising income
* Yucky Politics
* Idea of freeloading

## Solutions
1. Clean Energy (Advanced Technology)
2. Rich countries need to help poor ones (Financial/ Technical assistance)
    * Personal behavioural change
    * Current actions insufficient
    * Not even following targets
3. R&D plans, policies, market tools

# Pollution (Air Light Noise Plastic)
* SDG 7: Affordable & clean energy
* SDG 3: Good health/ wellbeing
* SDG 11: Sustainable cities/ communities

Presence of substances and heat in air, water, land, which produces undesirable environmental effects (due to humans)

## Air Pollution
* Air pollution is boomer (UK yucky)
* Emissions increased in developing, decreased in developed
* Poor people breathe poor air
* Deaths are from outdoor air + cooking with polluted fuel
* Messes up climate too

### Solution
* Legislation to regulate outdoor air quality
* Clean fuel/ cooking facilities

## Plastic Pollution
SDG14: Life below water

White Pollution (White plastic bags/ tableware)
* Fishing nets go craazy in pacific garbage patch
* Microplastic <5mm
    * Primary (intentionally small), Secondary (broken down)
    * Easy to eat!
    * Disrupts reproductiv system, growth, appetite, tissue inflamation, liver damage
* Nanoplastic (1nm-1microm)

### Solution
* Methodology for measurement currently in development
* Many countries don't recognise
* Citizen scientist data currently used
* 3 Rs + Responsibility (reduction in single-use packaging through product design/ business models)

## Noise pollution
Problems
* Deafness
* Singapore's average outdoor noise higher than recommended limit
* Enclosed areas trap sound

### Solution
* Be quieter LOL

## Light Pollution
Benefits of Light
1. Safety (accidents)
2. Reduce crime
3. Safer/ more accessible communities

Problems with light
* Living organisms (diurnal rhythm)
    * Messes up animal behaviour/ reproductive success
    * Turtle :(

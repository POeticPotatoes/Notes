# Cost of Capital

**Capital Budgeting** is the analysis of potential projects. It is an important decision that determines the future of a firm. Therefore companies need procedures to analyse and select long-term investments.

**Capital Structure** is the mix of debt, preferred stock and common equity used to finance a firm's assets

**Projects** are essentially assets that produce future cash flows.

## Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

$WACC = w_dr_d(1-T) + w_pr_p + w_cr_c$

$r_d$ - YTM on **existing outstanding bonds** of the company

$r_p$ - Found using  $r_p = D_p/P_0$

$r_s$ - Found using:
* CAPM
* DCF: $(D_1/P_0)+g$
* Bond Yield+RP: $r_d + RP$
> Bond Yield + RP is just a rough estimation and not based on any formulae


## Question of the Week

FM Donut Bakery's target capital structure is 50% debt and 50% common equity.
Currently, its common stock is traded at a price of $10 per share.
The company has just paid dividends of $1.10 per share.
The perpetual common dividend growth rate is constant at 5%.
FM has bonds outstanding at 10% annual coupon rate, but interest rates for bonds of equal risk are currently yielding 7% in the market.
FM's tax rate is 35%.

What is FMâ€™s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) if it finances new capital only with debt and retained earnings?

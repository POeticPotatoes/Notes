## Forms of business organisation
* Proprietorship: An unincorporated business owned by 1 individual
* Partnership: An unincorporated business owned by 2 or more persons
* Corporation: An incorporated business owned by many shareholders
    * Legal entity separate from owners
    * Ownership denoted by shares
    * Can be public or private

| Proprietorship & Partnership | Corporation |
|-|-|
| **Ease of formation, Subject to few regulations** | **Cost of set-up and report filing**
|| Management is more complex and hence there is a higher cost of set-up.
| **No Corporate Income Tax** | **Pays Double Taxation**
| Owners have only have to pay **personal income tax** rates ranging from 0 to 22% (in Singapore), depending on the level of personal total income. | For corporations in the US, they must first pay **corporate tax** before distributing profit to owners as **dividends**. As this is considered a form of personal income by law, owners then have to pay tax on their **dividend income**. <br> In Singapore, **there is no income tax on most dividends** so corporations in Singapore only experience **single taxation** of 17% corporate tax.
| **Difficult to raise capital** | **Easy to raise capital**
| Each partner and owner has **limited funds**. These organisations cannot raise funds by issuing **financial instruments** such as bonds and common stocks. | The company can raise capital by issuing **financial instruments** such as bonds or new common stocks.
| **Unlimited liability** |  **Limited liability** |
| **Partners and owners can lose more than what they have invested** in the company. If the business is sued or cannot pay its bills, partners and owners are **directly responsible** for the business's liabilities; They take **full responsibilities** of the business's debt | In the case of bankruptcy, shareholders (who are owners of the company) will lose **only the amount they have invested** in the **common stocks** of the company. They are not responsible for corporate debts; The **management team** will sell the company's assets to pay back debts. |
| **Limited life** | **Unlimited life, Easy Transfer of Ownership**
| Business lasts as long as the owner is still alive.| The company will stay alive as long as it is not **bankrupted** or **acquired**

> Note: While double taxation and corporate tax might be a difference between the forms of business, **it is generally not a consideration** when deciding the form of business to operate under.

> A major reason for a business owner choosing a corporate business over proprietorship is to avoid the unlimited responsibilities in the case that the company fails.

## Goals of Corporation
### Stock Prices, Market Price and Intrinsic Value
|Stock Price / Market value|Intrinsic Value
|-|-|
|Short-run concept|Long-run concept: Depends on firm's future performance and cash flow
|Set by the **Marginal Investor**: an investor active in the market and would tend to buy the stock if it is about the marginal price.| Investors try to **estimate** the intrinsic value of a stock and may come up with different estimates, based on **best available information**. <br> The person with the **best available information** is the most likely to come up with an accurate estimation of intrinsic value.

When a stock price is less than the intrinsic value, it is **undervalued**: It is good to buy the stock.  

When a stock price is more than the intrinsic value, it is **overvalued**: It is not good to buy the stock, and you may consider selling it.  

When the stock price is equal to the intrinsic value, it is in **equillibrium**: Investors are **indifferent** between buying and selling stock.

Ideally, managers should avoid actions that reduce intrinsic value, <ins>even if those decisions increase stock price in the short run</ins>. Therefore, it is important that management acts **legally, ethically and responsibly**.

> Conversely, even if a company is very profitable or is very rich in cash, it is not reason enough to engage in any form of donations or philanthropic contributions, unless they are related (at least indirectly) to its primary goal.  
> If shareholders are not convinced that a company's management is improving company performance (maximising shareholders' wealth), <ins> the stock price is likely to decrease </ins>

### Definition

Therefore, the primary financial goal of a corporation is to **maximise shareholders' wealth**, which can be translated to **maximising the intrinsic value of a stock**, which leads to **maximising the long run stock price**.

> Note: The financial goal of a corporation is not to maximise **accounting profits** as an accountant includes **non-cash items** such as **depreciation expense** in their calculations. Therefore accounting profits are not cash; in finance, cash is king.
>
> Additionally, accounting profits do not take into account the **risk of cash flows** to shareholders. Most investors are **risk-averse** and do not like risk. Furthermore, <ins>bondholders do not share in the gains if risky projcts turn out to be highly successful, but share in the losses if projects fail and drive the firm to bankruptcy.</ins> Hence the primary financial goal of a corporation is to maximise shareholders' wealth, and not to maximise accounting profit.

> **Depreciation expense** is an accounting method of allocating the cost of a **tangible asset** over its useful life. It is used to calculate the **net book value** of an asset after it has been used for some time. It is a **non-cash item**.

## Agency Problems

**Agency Problems** are conflicts of interest between **shareholders** and **managers**.

* Managers are naturally inclined to act in their own best interests (Which are not always the same as the interests of stockholders) especially when there is **no incentive** to work harder for an increase in salary or additional benefits.

#### Solutions
* Managerial compensation packages:  
    * Reward managers based on long-run intrinsic value of the company stock.  
    * As intrinsic value is an estimate and difficult to measure, this can be gauged by the long-term share price as a proxy. This is usually implemented as *executive stock options* that are vested over a period of 5 to 10 years.
    * If the stock is performing well and is expected to continue doing well, managers get more compensation; if not, they get less compensation to ensure that managers act to increase intrinsic value of a stock.
* Direct intervention by shareholders  
    Shareholders can give suggestions or opinions on what managers should do
* Threat of firing
* The threat of takeover

#### Questions
* Managerial compensation packages:
    * Management positions are not fixed; They may shift on yearly rotations or change due to promotion or company policy changes
    * This means that managers might not stay in their positions long enough to realise long term benefits to the intrinsic value of the company
    * Additionally, if an action is highly beneficial in the long run but damaging enough to profits that their average performance might fall in the short term, they might be deterred from taking those actions

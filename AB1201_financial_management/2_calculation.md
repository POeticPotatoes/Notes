## Learning Objectives:  
* Explain how time value of money works and why it is important in Finance
* Calculate the present value (PV) and future value (FV) of:
    * A lump sum
    * Annuity
    * Uneven cash flow stream
    * Perpetuity (only PV)
* Differentiate between annuity due and ordinary annuity
* Explain the differences between nominal, periodic, and effective interest rates
* Understand how to compare alternative investments with different compounding periods
* Understand loan amortisation and calculate the relevant outputs (e.g. payments, principal outstanding)

## Time Value of Money
**Time value of money** is the idea that <ins> money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future</ins>, because you can invest the money, eg:
* Depositing the money in a bank to earn interest
* Investing in stocks and bonds to earn returns from investment

It is used heavily in finance for purposes such as 
* Valuing stocks and bonds
* Planning retirement
* Making corporate decisions regarding investing in new plants and equipment
* Setting up loan payment schedules

### Amortization of Loans
**Future Value (FV)** of a loan is the value of a **current asset** with **principal value (PV)** at a future date based on an **assumed rate of growth or interest (I/Y)**. With $N$ as the number of steps:

$FV_N=PV(1+I)^N$

Finding the **FV** of a cash flow or series of cash flows is called **compounding**.

Finding the **PV** of a cash flow or series of cash flows is called **discounting**.

### Ordinary Annuity

**Annuity** is a series of **equal** cash flows at **fixed intervals** for a specified number of periods.

**Ordinary Annuity** means that cash flows occur at the **end of the period**.

**Annuity Due** means that cash flows occur at the **beginning of the period**.

$FV=\frac{PMT}{I}[(1+I)^N-1]$

$PV=\frac{PMT}{I}[1-\frac{1}{(1+I)^N}]$

This is the question of the week.
After going through the lesson, you will be able to answer such questions.
You are saving for retirement. You plan to retire when you reach 65 years old. To live comfortably during retirement, you plan to withdraw money from your savings account - $48,000 each year. Suppose today is your 25th birthday, and you decide, starting today and continuing on every year up to your 64th birthday, that you will put the same amount into a savings account.

If the interest rate is 2.4% per annum, compounded annually, how much must you set aside each year to make sure that you will have enough money in the account on your 65th birthday in order to be able to withdraw $48,000 per year when you retire and you expect to live until you are 90 years old (i.e., the first withdrawal is on your 65th birthday and the last withdrawal occurs on your 89th birthday)?

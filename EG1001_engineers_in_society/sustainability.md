**Mental Models** are explanations of the thinking process
* They affect what we see if they conflict with internal impressions
* They determine how we act

> Iceberg Analogy: Problems are best solved not on the level where they appear to occur but from a higher viewpoint (Identifying the deepest parts of the iceberg)
> * Reaction > Response > Design
> * Events > Patterns > Structure > Mental Models

## Ladder of Inference
Chris Argyris 1970, The Fifth Discipline (Peter Senge 1990)
1. Data
2. Observation
3. Beliefs
4. Prior Experience
5. Existing Assumptions
6. Conclusion

## Fifth Discipline: System thinking
1. Personal Mastery
    * Learning how to generate & sustain creative tension
    * Individual learning is necessary for organisational learning
2. Shared Vision
    * Establish primary goals
    * Keeps on track when stresses develop
3. Team Learning
    * Aligning & developing capacity of team to get truly desired results
4. Mental Model (Process of change)
    * Assessing current reality to create vision and creative tension
    * Changing Policies Processes and Organisation (PPO)
    * Changing Values and Mental Models
* Learning allows one to recrate themselves and reperceive the world
* Become able to do new things and extend their capacity to create

## State Transition Diagram (Blame Game)
> CHECK SLIDE 21 OF LECT 5
* Underlying problems generate syptoms that demand attention, so people shift the burden to solutions that address those symptoms
* Accidents are seldom attributed to a single person, but it can happen

## Swiss Cheese Model
James Reason
* The system fails due to holes
* Safety investigations check how it failed and where to correct 
* ie. accidents are always caused by multiple factors
    * A series of errors breaks throught the defense of an organisation
    * Defenses: Regultions, Design & Manufacture processes, SOP, Training & the operator
## Human factors
* Optimising human-system relationships improves safety quality efficiency
* Enhancing awareness and acquiring skills of human factor increases safety and encourages attitudes against unsafe behaviour
* Attributes
    * Human physiology
    * Anthropometrics (Measurements of the body)
    * Psychology
    * Workplace design
    * Environmental conditions
    * Human-machine interfaces

#### Error Chain
* A series of human factor problems can form an error chain reaching a poor conclusion
* Stopping the propagation of the error chain stops the accident
* It cannot be attributed to the intervention of some chance agency
* Intended(Violation)/ Unintended actions(Error)

**Slips Lapses, Mistakes**  
SLIDE 40 OF LECTURE 5

Violations are deliberate illegal actions
* There must be little tolerance for violations
* Violations weaken defences

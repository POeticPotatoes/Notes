## Socrates
The **Socratic Method** is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking/answering questions to simulate **critical thinking** and draw out **assumptions**. 
* Human choice is motivated by an **inner desire for happiness**
* Engineers can use the Socratic Method to derive **ethical judgement bbased on the inner self**

### Conversation with Crito
Crito:

Crito:
* Choosing the easiest path by agreeing to die
* Acting with cowardice
* Failure to escape would be due to shameful cowardice of Socrates' friends
* Ethical arguments:
    * Staying would aid his enemies in wronging him unjustly, and is hence unjust
    * Abandoning his sons

Socrates:
* Crito must be guided by reason
* The masses suck for thinking irrationally and acting randomly (Money, reputation and feeding children are values of thoughtless men)
* Only people who understand justice matter
* Only question: Whether it is unjust for Socrates to escape
* If injustice is bad, then injustice in response is also bad

Socrates:
* Voice of the laws of athens:
    * Laws exist as one entity: To break one is to break them all
    * Socrates would cause great harm, akin to striking a parent
    * Socrates should instead persuade the Laws to let him go
    * Citizens have a duty to follow laws in a **social contract**, and implicitly accept it by living in Athens
    * Socrates should act in accordance to his contract
    * Having endorsed the social contract and breaking it now, Socrates would bbe an outlaw, and it would be better not to attempt to do so
* Argument isn't whether the Law is correct but rather whether it must be followed (Crito agrees)

Julian Baggini: Morality is about the actions we need to do or to avoid, whereas ethics is what we need to do to flourish

## Oppenheimer's Dilemma (Atomic Bomb)
July 1945: Trinity  
Aug 1945: Hiroshima & Nagasaki
* Bombing was morally justified based on relative cost of human lives
* He felt responsible about ensuing arms race and threat to civilisation (Danger of proliferation)
* Objected to the development of the H-bomb (social & political consequences)
> Will the bomb be the bringer of Life in nuclear power & sustainable energy, or will Oppenheimer in death become the destroyer of our world?


## Disaster at Bhopal Plant
* Pesticide plant in India, part of Green Revolution
* Events:
    * Welcomed in Bhopal for economic potential
    * 2 Miles from city center, surrounding population exploded after construction
    * Classified as "general" industry after approving **MIC-based processes** and establishing a "hazardous industry zone" 15 miles away
* Reasons behind choosing Bhopal:
    * Centralised location
    * Railway system spanned the country
    * Large lake for water
    * Sufficient electricity & labor
* Gas leak of MIC (Methyl Isocyanice) killed 10k and injured 200k in the first 3 days
* Water leaked into the tank and heated up MIC, vaporising it
* Pressure relief valve opened and leaked MIC into the air

Reasons
* Curtailment of plant maintenance to cut costs was a major factor
* Tank temperature alarm was improperly set
* Refrigeration unit stopped working 5 months ago and wasn't repaired
* MIC storage content level did not follow recommended value
* Vent gas scrubber to neutralise vapours was not activated (manually) until vapour release occurred
* Flare tower to burn vapours was not functioning
* Water curtain spray was for small scale accidents

Learning Points:
* Several factors led to the disaster
    * Profit driven
    * Cost saving > Safety
    * Poor safety measures
* Solutions:
    * Emphasis on Safety
    * Follow & maintain guidelines
    * Mitigate severity of consequences
* Plant designers were fine, but:
    * Management was negligent
    * Union Carbide was negligent in not preparing an evacuation plan for the surrounding population
    * Govt was blamed for safety standards, local govt had no policy or zoning for inhabitants near the chemical plant
    * Bulk goes to UC for failure to train/supervise Indian employers

## Challenger Disaster
Jan 28 1986, 7 Astronauts killed while piloting the Challenger
* Rocket exploded seconds after takeoff due to failure of booster O-rings
    * Several factors: faulty design, lack of testing in low temperatures
* O-rings prevent hot gases from combustion of the solid propellant from escaping
    * O-rings were found to be inadequate and redesigned, delaying program
    * NASA budget was determined by Congress who was unhappy with delays
    * European Space Agency was competing for cheaper alternatives
    * NASA was pressured to launch the Challenger to examine Halley's Comet before Russians
    * Reagan planned to get first teacher in space before state-of-the-union address

Night Before:
* 14 Morton Thiokol engineers vigorously opposed the launch as it was too cold
* Temperatures were below tested safety range
* Engineers were aware of issues with the seals
* Roger Boisjoly & Annie Thompson presented on how cold would increase problems, but could not provide experimental data
* Bob Lund (VP) agreed with Jerald (General Manager) Mason to accept a launch recc (Biosjoly's influence was weak)
* NASA engineers did not know that the decision was not unanimous (Communication issue)

Reflection:
* Boisjoly described issue but was intiially ignored by managers
* Task force setup to tackle issue had no resources or support
* Should have whistleblown?

Aftermath:
* Families sued for 2-3.5 million, w/ Morton Thiokol paying 60%
* Boisjoly testified before Congress, left company and went through therapy for PTSD (Later won awards)

Risk Assessment:
* Feynman asked team to assess probability of incomplete launch, nobody could give an explanation for the 1 in 100k figure

### Nicoll Highway Collapse
20 April 2004, 3.30pm  
4 died: Crane operator, construction worker, inspector of works & construction supervisor
* Temporary retaining wall of the MRT Circle Line tunnel collapsed

Impacts
* Gas, water, electricity went out for 15k and 700 businesses in Marina & Suntec
* Police cordoned off Merdeka Bridge & other roads affecting thousands
* Excavation works for circle line were suspended
* Cost of damages was millions

Reasons
* Cut & Cover method was used
    * Create large cavity
    * Brace walls with strut-waler system
* Under-design of the diaphram wall and waler connection in strutting system
* Eventual failure of the 9th strut-waler connection & failure of other structures in redistributed loads

Aftermath
* Nishimatsu Construction fined 200k, 11.7m on rescue reconstruction & checks, barred from contracts
* Ng Seng Yoong (LTA Project Director) did not comply with his duties as a qualified person by not submitting his own assessment
    * Fined 8k and faced disciplinary action

Lessons
* Monitoring & instrumentation during construciton must be meticulously undertaken

## Chandrayaan-2 Launch
15 July 2019  
* India's first moon lander was postponed in the last 56 minutes due to suspected issues while filling rocket with cryogenic fuel
* Pressure to continue:
    * VIP's were gathered an all systems ready
    * Skies were cleared and India could be fourth on the moon

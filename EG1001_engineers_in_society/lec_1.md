### Definitions
**technology**   
is a form of **human cultural activity** for practical ends and purposes, and involves **forming and transforming** the material world through **ideas and thoughts** with the aid of **tools and procedures*.

It is about **solving problems and meeting needs** in the real world and includes **products processes & systems** that take the environment they were designed and used in into consideration

**engineering** is the use of science and technology for the convenience of man  

**science** is the study of how the physical world works  

> The relationships between the activities associated with them have changed and **will continue to evolve** over time

### History of Engineering
Q: How does history contribute to engineering?  
* History is a **chronology of past events** that helps us understand why things happened
* **Represent the past** in a way that makes more sense to the present
* Gives meaning to the **continuity** to a multiplicity of unrelated events   
   (ie. it makes the connection between engineering and different aspects of human society)

* Technology, science and engineering emerged as distinct areas of human endeavour in **different periods** of human history

#### Early Technologies
Origin of technology dates from the Stone Age  
Earliest human ancestors were **hunter-gatherers** who adpoted **systematic technological actions** to survive  
* Made tools from wood and stone for survival
* Stones were fractured to produce sharp edges for cutting
* Grinding stones, wedges, carrying yoke, ax and spear
* Developed the **controlled use of fire**, fashioning clothing & utensils

#### Agrarian Society
A **turning point** was achieved when fertile rivers provided favourable conditions for crop growth, establishing **Agrarian Societies** such as Mesopotamia, the Nile Valley, and India and China
* Animals were domesticated as **beasts of burden**
* Stayed put in a location to survive rather than wandering
* Developed transportation systems for mobility & building technologies
    * Primitive sledges for **crop transportation**
    * Use of level in a balance beam for weighing (Egypt 5000 B.C.)
    * Use of wheels for potter's wheels & chariots (Mesopotamia 3500 B.C.)
    * Smelting & working of metals
    * Large-scale control of **water resources**
* Building materials: Mesopotamians: Clay & Brick, Egyptians: Stones
* Subsequent Greek culture was built on egyptian foundation
> Pyramid of Gizah: 230m square, 147m high using 2-30 tonne stone blocks with insane accuracy

#### Classical Antiquity
Greeks laid the first **philosophical & scientific basis for knowledge** (600 B.C.)
* Thales, Socrates & Plato attempted to explain the world based on **rationality**
* Euclid, Pythagoras & Plato struggled to find **philosophical basis** for natural phenomena & humanity's place in the universe
* Archimedes (287-212 B.C.) used mechanical models to arrive at mathematical results, but discarded them in his proofs
* Greek technological achievements were not spectacular because **scholars disdained practical craft skills**

After defeating the greeks in the Battle of Corinth in 146 B.C., Romans then inherited Greek philosophy and mathematics but **did not encourage abstract science**
* Engineering practices became more discrete
* Engineers were competent in contracts, specifications & consting
* Inventions:
    * Road systems as key military technology that facilitated rapid troop movement
    * Hydraulics in bringing water to towns with stone aqueducts and lead pipes
* Rome then became **technologically stagnant** and crumbled around (400-500 A.D.):
    * Productivity was limited by the use of **slaves** that precluded efforts to develop labor-saving technology
    * Engineering was driven by imperial military endeavours to invade/fortify cities

Post Roman Empire Development
* Relative chaos ensued after Rome collapsed
* Expanding populations led to the cultivation of forested lowlands that required **new agricultural technology** to till the heavier soils of Northern Europe

#### Feudalism
By 900 A.D. feudalism emerged where kings & nobles gave **land-grants** (not ownership) to members of their retinues who provided military services
* Peasants became serfs to work the lands, leading to the **primitive accumulation of capital** that gave rise to the **middle class**
* Political Sovereignity was fragmented, leading to the growth of **free cities**

### Examples
Cai Lun CE48-121 invented the composition of paper and its papermaking process

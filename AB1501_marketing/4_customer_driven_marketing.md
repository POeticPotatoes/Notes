* Product
* Price
* Place
* Promotion

### Product
**Product** is anything (tangible or intangible) that can be offered in a market for attention, acquisition, use, or consumption that might satisfy a need or want

> The separation of tangible and intangible goods is never concrete as factors like service and value added are always elements of a good, with **varying extent**.

* Variety
* Quality
* Design
* Features
* Brand Name  
    In which **consistency** of brand image across different mediums is of high importance
    * Manufacturer's (National) Brand
    * Store/Private/House Brand
    * Licensing
    * Co-Branding
* Packaging
* Services

**Product classifications:**
* Consumer Products
* Inducstrial products
* Product Mix - mix width and length and depth (in degrees of specificity)  
    This can be increased by acquiring other services, or new product development. However, estimates expect 90% of new products to fail.

**Characteristics and Nature of Services**
* Intangibility - They cannot be experienced before purchase
* Inseparability - They cannot be separated from providers
* Perishability - They cannot be stored for later use
* Variability - Quality depends on who provides them, when, where, how

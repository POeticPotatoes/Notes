# Ntu Notes

This is a repository I use to store notes I take from lectures/tutorials in NTU. Folders are named by course code and name, and all notes are taken in markdown.

Each folder may contain a file `course_details.md` which may include information about the course, or other miscellaneous information that I might need to take note of. All other files are prefixed with a number eg.1_number_sets.md which denotes the order in which those notes were taken.

If you see any errors in my notes or think they can be improved, feel free to fork and pull request my stuff.

Enjoy!

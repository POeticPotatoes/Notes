## Common Solutions to Data Science Problems
### Regression (Numeric)

Model: $Sales = \mathbb{f}(Variables)$
* Linear Regression
* Tree Models
* Neural Network

### Classification (Classes)
Model: $\mathbb{P}(Admit) = \mathbb{f}(Variables)$, where $\mathbb{P}$ represents a mapping to different classes
* Logistic Regression
* Tree Models
* Neural Network

### Clustering (Structure)
Identification of Distance
* Euclidean, Jaccard
* k-Means Algorithm for clustering
* Hierarchical Model for clustering

### Anomaly Detection (Anomaly)
Can be based on different models
* Cluster-Analysis
* Nearest Neighbour
* Support Vector

### Adaptive Learning (Decision Making)
Model: Optimising the profit obtained from $\mathbb{f}(State,Variables)$ where $\mathbb{f}$ denotes the decision-making model
* Reinforcement Learning Approach
* Monte-Carlo, State-Action-Reward
* Q-Learning, Deep Reinforcement

# Cash Flow Estimation

Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Notes Payable + Accruals

$NOWC=Current\ Assets-(Accrued\ wages\ and\ taxes+Accounts\ payable)$

$EBIT=Revenue-Operating\ Costs-Depreciation$

$FCF = [EBIT(1-T)+Depreciation]-[Capital\ Expenditures+\Delta NOWC]$

This is yor Capital Expenditures  
Equipment 200k + 40k  
Depreciated under MACRS  
Salvage value of 25k after 4 years  

Changes to NOWC:
Inventories increase $25k (Current assets increase by 25k)  
Accounts payable increase $5k  
Use the formula to get 20k change in NOWC

New sales of 100k bottles at $2 (200k)  
Total operating expenses are 60% of dollar sales  

Tax rate 40%  
Cost of capital (WACC) is 10%

# Basics of Capital Budgeting
## Steps to Capital Budgeting
1. Estimate Cash Flows
    - Initial investments
    - Subsequent cash inflows/outflows
2. Assess riskiness of CFs and determine the appropriate risk-adjusted cost of capital for discounting cash flows (Calculate risk)
3. Find NPV and/or IRR(MIRR)

## Question of the Week
Given that WACC of FM Donut is 10.55%.
Suppose a new project has the same risk as the rest of the company and suppose the project lasts for 3 years.
The project requires an initial investment of $89,000 in Year 0, the projected cash flows in Year 1 and Year 2 are $27,550 each and the projected cash flow in Year 3 is $52,750.

Calculate the projectâ€™s NPV, IRR, and MIRR.
Should the project be accepted?


google acquiring android as an example of acquiring a negative npv for expected growth
isnt android an open source project, meaning to say that it is free, how would that result in future cash flows

# Bonds and Valuation

Companies can raise capital in many ways, such as issuing bonds. They function like a loan between investors and corporations: The investor gives the corporation a specified amount of money in exchange for **interests payments at specified intervals**.

    Bonds are a long-term debt instrument 
    in which a borrower agrees to make payments of principal and interest, 
    on specific dates, to the holders of the bond.
    
Basic types of bonds include:
* Zero coupon bond
* Coupon bond

## Bond Terminology
Fixed on a bond certificate:
* Maturity date - date the bond must be repaid
* Par value - Face amount of the bond, paid at **maturity** ($FV$)
* Coupon - amount paid by the issuer regularly
* Payment Frequency - frequency of coupon payments
* Coupon interest rate - stated interest rate (generally **fixed**) paid by the issuer. Coupon = Coupon interest rate * Par value

Not fixed on a bond contract:
* Yield to Maturity YTM / Promised Yield - **nominal** rate of return earned on a bond held until maturity 
* Price of bond
* Yield to maturity
* Discount Rate \(r\) / Required Rate of Return - the **opportunity cost** of debt capital:
    It is the rate that could be earned on alternative investments of **equal risk**.

## Bond Valuation
The value of a financial asset is equal to its **present value** of all future cash flows that will be received from the asset.

$PV = \frac{CF_1}{(1+r)^1}+\frac{CF_2}{(1+r)^2}+...+\frac{CF_n}{(1+r)^n}$

$PV = \frac{PMT}{I}[1-\frac{1}{(1+I)^4}] + \frac{FV}{(1+I)^4}$

$r = r^* + IP + MRP + DRP + LP$

Cash Flows (CF) for bonds would be the coupon payments, and payment of par value at maturity.
> Two annual bonds with the same maturity and risks **MUST** have the same r!

If yield < coupon rate, then bond price > par value, hence it is a *premium bond*.  
If yield = coupon rate, then bond price = par value, hence it is a *par bond*.  
if yield > coupon rate, then bond price < par value, hence it is a *discount bond*.

## Total Return Identity

Expected total return = $YTM$ = (Expected CY) + (Expected CGY)  

Current yield $CY = \frac{Annual\ Coupon\ Payment}{Price_t}$  

Capital gains yield $CGY=\frac{Price_{t+1}-Price_t}{Price_t}$

## Risks of a Bond
* Investment Risk:
    - Interest Rate Risk (Price Risk)
    - Reinvestment Risk
* Default Risk

### Interest Rate Risk
**Interest Rate Risk** is the concern that rising $r_d$ will cause the value of a bond to fall.
* All else being equal, bonds with longer maturity have higher interest rate risk.
### Reinvestment Risk
**Reinvestment risk** is the concern that $r_d$ will fall, and future CFs will have ot be reinvested at lower rates, hence reducing income
* All else being equal, bonds with shorter maturity have higher reinvestment risk
### Default Risk
**Default risk** is the risk of an issuer defaulting; investors will receive less than the promised return.
* This is influenced by the issuer's **financial strength** and the terms of the bond contract.
* **Bond ratings** reflect the probability of a bond issue going into default

<hr>
This is the question of the week. After going through the lesson you will be able such question.
You are considering a 7-year, $1,000 par value bond. Its coupon rate is 9%, and coupon is paid semiannually. Its yield to maturity (YTM) is 8.96%.

a) How much should you be willing to pay for the bond today?
b) If you plan to hold the bond for 3 years then sell it, how much should you sell the bond at the end of year 3, assuming there is no change in YTM?

# Flowcharts and Pseudocode

**Top down methodology** is the formulation of a computable method/procedure (ie. an Algorithm) with techniques such as Divide and Conquer: Splitting a problem into subproblems(recursively)

**Flowcharts** are a representation of an algorithm using a diagram for effective visualisation. They can consist of:
* Ovals (Beginning and end of program)
* Flow Line (Denotes direction of logic)
* Parallelogram (Denotes an I/O operation)
* Rectangle (Denotes a process to be carried out)
* Diamond (Denotes decision or branch to be made)

Flowcharts contain **flow control** elements such as conditionals, forking, looping etc.

**Pseudocode** uses informal english to describe an algorithm step by step <ins>with one step per line</ins>. It utilises structural conventions of programming languages but is intended for human understanding rather than machine interpretation. It:
* Follows no strict rules (eg. syntax or functions)
* Uses informal language with a combination of english and programming keywords (if, else, while, for etc, or print/read/compute)
* Usually starts an operation sentence with a verb (for brevity and precision)
* Guidelines:
    * One statement per line
    * Capitalise keywords
    * Indent to show hierarchy
    * End multi-line structures ("}")
    * Keep statements programming-language independent (Avoid language specific libraries/functions)
> Note: Should be generally fine as long as syntax is similar to Java

# Introduction to Computational Thinking and Programming

**Computational Thinking** is a **problem solving process** that formulates the solution to a problem in the form of **algorithms**. These problems are solved with the use of a computer and consists of several parts.

An **algorithm** is a sequence of step by step instructions to tell a computer how to solve a problem. They are used extensively in many real world applications.

## Programming Languages
This course teaches us how to write in the high-level python programming language (yawn).

We will learn about the internal operations of the computer (machine instructions) and how they are abstracted by programming languages to perform complex actions in small amounts of time.

We will learn basic program structure and representation of them in a flowchart and pseudocode, data types and variables, flow control, as well as algorithms like recursion and iteration.

Keywords learnt: **Abstraction, Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Algorithm Design** (another yawn)

**Abstraction** simplifies a complex problem with algorithms and data structures to obscure inner implementation from an outside user, allowing for ease of use

**Decomposition** Breaks a problem into smaller and more manageable parts

**Pattern Recognition** involves identifying similar problems to apply algorithms and data structures to them effectively

**Algorithm Design** entails the implementation of algorithms and data structures; Converting it into instructions for a machine to execute

**Algorithm Complexity**: Often described in Big O notation: The change in time/memory required for a program to execute against a change in input or data size. This tells us about the scalability of our algorithms

**Computing Trends**: For example, the exponential growth of memory size and computing power of machines and how it affects how code is written

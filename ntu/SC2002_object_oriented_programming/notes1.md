## Basic Components of OOP
### Entities
* Objects  
    Contains **attributes** that describe the state of real world objects, and **methods** that describe actions of the object
* Messages  
    Requests from one object to another for the receiver to produce a desired result
* Methods  
    Descriptions of actions that an object performs when it recieves a message (Services provided, Operations performed, Interfaces provided)
* Classes  
    A template for objects which consists of methods and state descriptions that objects belong to

### Concepts
* **Abstraction**  
    The essential characteristics of an object that distinguish it from others (a conceptual boundary)
* **Encapsulation**  
    Building a barrier to protect private data. Private data may only be accessed through public functions.  
    Information hiding that hides details/implementation of classes from users. Users only need to know what a class does and how to call methods.
* **Polymorphism**  
    Same message can be sent to different objects, each object performs an appropriate operation. Sending object does not need to know the class of the recieving object or how it responds.
* **Inheritance**  
    Defines a new class that inherits attributes and methods from a parent class. New classes can be created without duplicate code.

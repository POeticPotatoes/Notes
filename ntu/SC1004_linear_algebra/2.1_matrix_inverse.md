# Inverse of a Matrix

> If $A$ is an invertible $n * n$ matrix, then for each $b$ in $\R^n$ the equation $Ax=b$ has the <ins>unique solution</ins> $x=A^{-1}b$.

> If $A$ is an invertible matrix, then $A^{-1}$ is invertible and $(A^{-1})^{-1}=A$
> If $A$ and $B$ are invertible, then so is $AB$ and $(AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}$
> IF $A$ is invertible, then so is $A^T$ and $(A^T)^{-1}=(A^{-1})^T$

An **elementary matrix** is one that is obtained by performing a single elementary row operation on an identity matrix

> An $nxn$ matrix $A$ is invertible iff $A$ is row equivalent to $I_n$ and in this case, any sequence of elementary row operations that reduces $A$ to $I_n$ also tranforms $I_n$ to $A^{-1}$.

## Upper and Lower Triangular
#### Use cases
Steps:
1. $Ax = b$
2. $LUx = b$
3. Let $y = Ux$
4. $Ly = b$, Solve for y
5. $Ux = y$, Solve for x

#### Factorization Procedure
There exist **unit lower triangular** elementary matrices $E_1,...,E_p$ such that:

$E_p..E_1A=U\\
\implies    A=(E_p...E_1)^{-1}U = LU\\
\therefore L=(E_p..E_1)^-1$

In other words, the same row operations that reduce $A$ to $U$ also reduce $L$ to $I$.

### Definitions
**technology**   
is a form of **human cultural activity** for practical ends and purposes, and involves **forming and transforming** the material world through **ideas and thoughts** with the aid of **tools and procedures*.

It is about **solving problems and meeting needs** in the real world and includes **products processes & systems** that take the environment they were designed and used in into consideration

**engineering** is the use of science and technology for the convenience of man  

**science** is the study of how the physical world works  

> The relationships between the activities associated with them have changed and **will continue to evolve** over time

### History of Engineering
Q: How does history contribute to engineering?  
* History is a **chronology of past events** that helps us understand why things happened
* **Represent the past** in a way that makes more sense to the present
* Gives meaning to the **continuity** to a multiplicity of unrelated events   
   (ie. it makes the connection between engineering and different aspects of human society)

* Technology, science and engineering emerged as distinct areas of human endeavour in **different periods** of human history

#### Early Technologies
Origin of technology dates from the Stone Age  
Earliest human ancestors were **hunter-gatherers** who adpoted **systematic technological actions** to survive  
* Made tools from wood and stone for survival
* Stones were fractured to produce sharp edges for cutting
* Grinding stones, wedges, carrying yoke, ax and spear
* Developed the **controlled use of fire**, fashioning clothing & utensils

#### Agrarian Society
A **turning point** was achieved when fertile rivers provided favourable conditions for crop growth, establishing **Agrarian Societies** such as Mesopotamia, the Nile Valley, and India and China
* Animals were domesticated as **beasts of burden**
* Stayed put in a location to survive rather than wandering
* Developed transportation systems for mobility & building technologies
    * Primitive sledges for **crop transportation**
    * Use of level in a balance beam for weighing (Egypt 5000 B.C.)
    * Use of wheels for potter's wheels & chariots (Mesopotamia 3500 B.C.)
    * Smelting & working of metals
    * Large-scale control of **water resources**
* Building materials: Mesopotamians: Clay & Brick, Egyptians: Stones
* Subsequent Greek culture was built on egyptian foundation
> Pyramid of Gizah: 230m square, 147m high using 2-30 tonne stone blocks with insane accuracy

#### Classical Antiquity
Greeks laid the first **philosophical & scientific basis for knowledge** (600 B.C.)
* Thales, Socrates & Plato attempted to explain the world based on **rationality**
* Euclid, Pythagoras & Plato struggled to find **philosophical basis** for natural phenomena & humanity's place in the universe
* Archimedes (287-212 B.C.) used mechanical models to arrive at mathematical results, but discarded them in his proofs
* Greek technological achievements were not spectacular because **scholars disdained practical craft skills**

After defeating the greeks in the Battle of Corinth in 146 B.C., Romans then inherited Greek philosophy and mathematics but **did not encourage abstract science**
* Engineering practices became more discrete
* Engineers were competent in contracts, specifications & consting
* Inventions:
    * Road systems as key military technology that facilitated rapid troop movement
    * Hydraulics in bringing water to towns with stone aqueducts and lead pipes
* Rome then became **technologically stagnant** and crumbled around (400-500 A.D.):
    * Productivity was limited by the use of **slaves** that precluded efforts to develop labor-saving technology
    * Engineering was driven by imperial military endeavours to invade/fortify cities

Post Roman Empire Development
* Relative chaos ensued after Rome collapsed
* Expanding populations led to the cultivation of forested lowlands that required **new agricultural technology** to till the heavier soils of Northern Europe

#### Feudalism
By 900 A.D. feudalism emerged where kings & nobles gave **land-grants** (not ownership) to members of their retinues who provided military services
* Peasants became serfs to work the lands, leading to the **primitive accumulation of capital** that gave rise to the **middle class**
* Political Sovereignity was fragmented, leading to the growth of **free cities**
* City/Town growth led to **commodity production**
* Formation of **craft guilds** which planned production and supervised, trained & employed workmen
* Economy was based on serfs and craft workers which encouraged the use of **labor-saving technology**
* Movement away from agricultural production

#### Monarchy System
* Outbreak of bubonic plague in 1348
    * 40% of the population died over 2 generations, resulting in **labor shortage**
    * Power based on land-holding was challenged by town-based merchants, leading to a **move away from feudalism**
    * Power became increasingly centralised in **monarchs** who were suspicious of feudal barons
* Emergence of medieval technologies in the military & printing strengthened monarchies
* Introduction of:
    * Standing armies
    * Permanent bureaucracy
    * Taxation
    * Law
    * Beginning of unified markets
Rich monarchs set the conditions for the rise of **merchant capitalism**, and ships set sail for the discovery of America

#### Renaissance
Rediscovery of ancient Greek & Roman culture and the discovery of America brought new ideas & knowledge to Europe
* Poets, artists & sculptors embraced new **humanistic perspectives** that were far from medieval **religious symbolism**
* Centers were established for learning in theology, law & medicine
* Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519)

At the end of the 16th century, the **Scientific Revolution** occurred where observation & experiment challenged centuries-old dogma in their representation of nature
* Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) developed the telescope and concluded that the Earth revolved around the Sun
* Francis Bacon (1561-1626) promoted industrial science and used the **inductive approach** to draw conclusions from experimental data
* Rene Descartes (1596-1650) emphasized the **deductive approach** through mathematics and **advocated that science & religion should be spearated**, promoting the advance of science

In the 17th Century, the Scientific World View triumphed:
* The rise of **capitalism** led to a renewed interest in the **practicality of knowledge** in artisan trade practices
* The middle ages' assumptions and attitudes gave way to a world view that was **much less controlled by the Church**
    * Acceptance of the Solar System
    * Newton's law was confirmed and knowledge became a **means of controlling nature**

#### Exploration & Empire Building
Ships with naviational aids and firearms set out to explore & conquer foreign lands
* 16th Century - Spain & Portugal led overseas conquests for precious metals
* Early 17th Century - Netherlands dominated world trade & founded profitable empires in the East & West Indies
* Britain then surpassed the Netherlands using its vast coal deposits

Capital Accumulation, Agricultural Revolution
* In 1624, British parliament **reduced royal power**
    * Previously, monopolies in mining, manufacturing & foreign trade were granted by monarchs to favourites/merchant guilds
    * Land holding under the feudal system was abolished and large estates were sold
    * Rich merchants implemented **efficient large-scale scientific farming practices** to satisfy expanding markets

By the 18th Century, urban merchants gained control of commodity production with their banking & exchange practices
* Capitalists formed a **new social class** and challenged religious authority & hereditary privileges
* They emphasized **individual freedom to invest & trade**
* European industrial takeoff was financed by colony plunder
* **Continuous exploitation of colonial resources** left a legacy of under-developed colonies

#### Industrial Revolution
English guilds were weakened by **anti-monopoly legislation**, and the development of machines led to a the **modern industrial revolution**
* Abraham Darby discovered how to smelt iron with coal (1709)
* Adam Smith described the **division of labor** in pin making (1776)
* Standardised production processes could be replaced by **machines**

* Mechanisation of tasks led to **profusion of machines**
* Journeymen were reduced to **machine minders** who sold raw labor to factory & mill owners
* The revolution provided **employment** for people displaced from the land
* Large population growth fuelled the revolution and provided labor & demand for industries
* Steam power was harnessed by the early 17th Century
    * Thomas Savery invented & patented a primitive steam engine (1698)
    * James Watt (1736-1819) improved on its efficiency & introduced adaptation to produce rotary motion (1782), driving British industry to **world leadership**
    * Formed the basis for **mechanical engineering**

Richard Trevithick built the first steam-powered locomotive (1804), and iron rails were introduced by 1825. George Stephenson's "Rocket" locomotive (1829) set the stage for the railway age.
* Railway enabled the movement of people & goods quickly, reliably & economically, opening up **broader markets for goods & services**
* Railroads was a major factor in colonisation of the rest of the world

The *Crystal Palace Exhibition* in London in 1851 was a celebration of British engineers & engineering and marked the **highest point of British industrial ascendancy**

Britain's loss of industrial leadership from the 1850's reflected societal complacency
* Peaceful and protracted transfer of power from an aristocracy to a capitalist state fostered a **self-limiting development** in Britain
* Industrialisation was **indigenous** and accomodated to existing social structure
* Pressures to adopt values and interests of industrialisation were **resisted by the ruling elite**
* Universities emphasized the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, neglecting & undervaluing commercial application
* Standardisation was discouraged and the dominance of the steam engine delayed development of other power sources in Britain
> France & Germany developed the **internal combustion machine** without real competition

#### Rise of the United States
* Settlers in the US were extremely **utilitarian** and dissented from established churches
* Knowledge was seen as a **commodity** to satisfy human needs which lead to a **frontier spirit of inventiveness**
* Introduction of machine shop techniques to develop grinding & milling industrial equipment reduced dependence on labour
* Early American Republic leaders recognised the need for **domestic manufacture**, especially in military equipment
* Expansion of American railroads opened up **national markets for machine tools**
* Tensions between the slave-owning South and the industrialised North led to the **American Civil War** where both sides fought with **modern weapons**
    * Railroads subsequently united the nation to move ahead, with the 1st trans continental rail link used to manufacture consumer products with buffalo skins

* US consumers were prepared to buy standard items and created the opportunity for **mass production**
* **Technological convergence** occurred where **key metal-working industries** experienced common **technological needs**
    * The same machine tools were used across industries: guns->machine tools->sewing machines->bicycles->motorcycles->automobiles
    * Machine tools's were able to produce **standardised interchangeable parts**
    * Henry Ford used **moving assembly-line** techniques to produce automobiles

#### Start of Modern Industrial Era
From 1860-1900, **manufacturing replaced agriculture** as the leading source of economic growth in the US
* Manufacturers shifted from producing products for consumers to producers
    * Heavy industry - steel, iron, petroleum & machinery grew rapidly
    * Raw material prices fell which stimulated new demand & further technological changes

* Bismarck became Chancellor of Germany in 1871 and led a **drive towards industrialisation**
    * Created a state-owned national railway to open up the internal market
    * Pushed to expand foreign exports of industrial products
    * Strongly promoted **education relevant to industrialisation**
    * German manufacturers set up integrated **industrial research laboratories**
    * By 1900 Germany surpassed Britain, especially in **university-level technical expertise**

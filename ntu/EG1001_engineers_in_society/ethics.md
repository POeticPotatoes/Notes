> Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET): By the time of graduation, students will have an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility

## Attributes of an Engineer
**Engineer of 2020**: 
* Strong practical skills
* Practical ingenuity, creativity; innovation
* Good communication skills
* Business & management skills
* **High ethical standards, professionalism**
* Dynamic/agile/resilient/flexible
* Lifelong learner
* Able to put problems in their socio-technical & operational context
* Adaptive learner

A **Profession** is a group that 
1. Claims special knowledge or expertise
2. Warrants special privileges & trust from the public

A professional engineer:
1. Has a degree in engineering from an accredited school
2. Performs engineering work
3. Is a registered P.E. or given authority to certify work
4. Acts in a morally permissible way while practicing engineering

Purpose of an engineer
* Not just building things & developing processes
* Things and processes are built to  **improve life**
* **Constant reflection on the products & processes made is compulsory**
***

**Two Dimensions of Ethics in Engineering**
* Engineers must be **socially responsible** when building products/processes for society
* Social responsibility requires **professional responsibility** (duties & obligations)
***
* Most education is focused on **doing things right**, and the application of **technical knowledge to society**, but learning **how to do the right thing** is important
* Engineers are often placed into conflict situations, and must be able to resolve them in an ethical manner

    eg. The Engineering commitment to safety vs other factors that a management must consider
* Engineers provide services or make judgements **not easily understood** by the public, and society is impacted when clients trust an engineer's **professional judgement**
> Engineering is a profession serving society, hence society imposes **special obligations** on engineers via a **code of ethics**

### Types of Ethics
Ethics is a **code** or system of rules defining **moral behavior** for a society, and is the sutdy of the **morality of human actions**. Most professional societies have **written codes** of ethics
* Etiquette: Rules of acceptable personal behaviour and courtesy
* Law: System of rules & punishments clearly defined & established by society to maintain a safe & orderly social environment
* Morality: **Personal** rules of right and wrong behavior derived from upbringing, religious beliefs & societal influences

Ethical problems tend to be **similar to engineering design**
> Morality is about making choices with reasons, while ethics is the study of how those choices are made

### Professional Engineer Act (PE Act)

A set of rules relating to the code of professional conduct & ethics that applies to a registered professional engineer, licensed, corporation or partnership.

Concerns:
* Establishment of the PE board
* Registration of PEs
* Licensing of corporations, partnerships, limited liability partnerships (LLPs)
* Regulating conduct of professional engineers

Establishment:
* Singapore Professional Engineers Board

Registration:
* A PE must be **registered** if they want to engage in work
* To supply a PE service, one must be a registered PE on their own or as a partner in a partnership (licensed partnership, LLP or partnership of all PEs)
* Otherwise, only **licensed corporations** or **limited liabiltiy partnerships** can supply PE services
* Registration includes a **Professional Practice Examination PPE** which tests the:
    1. Ability to apply knowledge and experience in PE practice
    2. Knowledge of rules & regulations in the practice of engineering in civil, electrical or mechanical engineering, including questions on **Professional Conduct and Ethics**

### USA NSPE Code of Ethics
Mentions that engineers must exhibit the **highest standards of honesty & integrity**, and that engineering has a **direct & vital impact on the quality of life**, and hence require **honesty, impartiality, fairness and equity** in services provided, and that they must be dedicated to the **protection of public health safety & welfare**.  ie. Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior that requires adherence to the  **highest principles of ethical conduct**

#### Area of Competence
* An engineer should offer services or undertake professional assignments **only in their areas of competence**
* This includes excercising care and communicatng clearly when accepting or interpreting assignments and setting outcomes
* They are also responsible for **calling and obtaining the services of a specialist or expert if required**.
* Such a requirement requires **honesty** to the client/employer and oneself

**Public Statements**
* Must be made in an objective & truthful manner

**Deceptive Acts**
* Must be avoided and one should never attempt to deliberately decieve the customer/client

**Faithful agent & trustee**
* Engineers should disclose all known/potential conflicts of interest
* Engineers should not accept bribery of any form

**Conduct**
* Honorably, reponsibly, ethically, lawfully to enhance the honor, reputation & usefullness of the profession


> Thereofre, a PE should NOT sign documents such as specifications or reports unless he has **prepared them** or **supervised** their preparation

### Paramountcy Principle
Engineers must **hold paramount** the safety, health & welfare of the public (in the performance of their professional duties)

This principle **overrides all other considerations**.

> Conscience is **INSUFFICIENT** as the code protects engineers from other pressures, and prevents them from acting in their or their employers' **self-interest**

### Case Study: Ford Pinto (Death Trap)
August 10, 1978: A Ford pinto was hit from behind on a highway in Indiana. The fuel tank caught fire and killed three teenage girls.
* Ford was found negligent in a criminal court and charged for the deaths
* The gas tank design was **flawed** and not in line with accepted standards, **although it met applicable federal safety standards at the time**
* Ford engineers were **aware of the dangers** and knew the rear end structure was **unsatisfactory**
* Estimated deaths would have been **49.5m USD** whereas suggested changes would have cost **137m USD**, hence they opted **not to adopt safety features until required by law**
* The lawsuit cost Ford **128m USD** and ruined the reputation of Ford

Conflicts: 
* Safety of the passengers vs Production of the Pinto at competitive prices
* Duty to the public vs Duty to employers
> While ethical dilemmas are often hard choices, good ethical reasoning can arrive at a **creative solution** which satisfies both sides

### Case Study: Therac-25
Radiation therapy machine created in 1982
* Multiple design errors and safety mechanism failures due to integer overflow
* Led to at least 6 radiation overdoses, 3 deaths

Causes:
* Insufficient resources for software (1 Engineer)
* Insufficient testing, inappropriate use of prev-gen control software
* Initial denial and slow response to problems

### Case Study: Hotel New World Disaster
15 March 1986, built in 1971
* 36 concrete columns supporting 6 concrete floors
* 33 deaths, 17 survivors
* Architect's plans were drawn up by an unqualified draftsman, Leong Shui Lung

### Whistleblowing Guidelines
1. Harm done is serious and considerable
2. Concerns are made known to superiors
3. No satisfaction from immediate superiors and exhausting channels including board of directors
4. Documented evidence that convinces a neutral party that their view of the situation is correct

Texas Instruments Ethics Test
1. Is the action legal
2. Does it comply with values
3. Will you feel bad
4. How will it look in the news
5. If it's wrong, don't do it
6. If not sure, ask
7. Keep asking until you get an answer

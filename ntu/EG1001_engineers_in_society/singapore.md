## Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment
**Safety**: State of being away from physical harm

**Risk**: Possibility of unpleasant or undesirable outcomes

**Hazard**: Danger to health, safety, plans, reputation

**Threat**: May cause harm to person, thing, organisation, system

**Risk Management**: Eradication/minimsation of adverse effects of risk

### Risk Assessment in Aircraft Accidents
* Risk determination (Probability of occurrence)
* Risk evaluation (Risk avoidance & Risk outcome)
* Risk Measurement (Quantitative measures of risk)

### Types of Risk
> Total Risk = Identified Risk + Unidentified Risk
* Acceptable risk -> Allowed to persist
* Unacceptable risk -> Cannot be tolerated, must be elimainated/controlled
* Residual risk -> acceptable + unidentified risk (after mitigation efforts)
* Honest errors are not an issue, but wilful fiolations & gross negligence are

Benefits:
* Risk management reduces reliance on intuition
* Clear understanding of unnecessary risks with no benefits
* Accepting risk as a function of risk assessment+management, which has high undertanties

#### 3 Areas of Safety Risk 
1. Hazard identification
2. Risk assessment & mitigation
    1. Probability
    2. Severity
    3. Exposure
3. Internal safety investigation

Stages of risk management
1. Identifying Hazards
    1. Stop and look
    2. think through
    3. identify hazards
    4. control + communicate
    5. do safely
2. Assessing sources & implications
3. Deciding on course of action & Communicating risk
4. Evaluating results

#### Risk Matrix
Severity categories
1. Minor -> MC<4
2. Moderate -> >4 days
3. Major -> Fatality, permanent

Likelihood categories
1. Remote -> Once in 5 years
2. Possible -> Once in a year
3. Frequent -> >=1 per month

> A **Risk Evaluation Matrix** can then be used
Acceptability of Risk
* < 3 Low
* 3-4 Medium (Moderately Acceptable)
* \> 4 High

#### Risk Control Measures
From most to least preferred
1. Eliminate/Substitute
2. Engineering controls
3. Admin measures
4. PPE
5. Safe work procedures

#### High Consequence Industries
For dangerous industries, Accident & Incident reporting are essential

## Singapore Data
Fatality rate: 1.9 per 100k workers employed (2016)  
Workplace Safety & Health Act (WSHAC) took effect in 1 Sep 2006, replacing the Factories act
* All involved in the workplace take personal responsibility for safety standards
* Aimed to reduce deaths by 1/3, and 1/2 within a decade
* Key Changes:
    1. Specifies liabilities for a range of persons rather than the occupier
    2. Focuses on effective management of safety instead of prescribing rules
    3. Stipulates greater penalties for compromising safety & health
    4. Facilitates enforcement with remedial orders
    * Managing Risk -> Identifying & Eliminating risks before creation
    * Compliance -> Proactive planning for safety
    * Costliness -> oops
* Came into force: 1 Mar 2006
* Now covers all workplaces, except uniform groups
    * SAF, SPF, Prison, Internal Security, Narcotics, ICA, Civil Defense

Changes
* Flexible & practical regulatory framework
* Practical assistance & training is now provided
* Robust inspection frameworks
* Reactive -> Participative -> Proactive -> Progressive -> Exemplary

Impact
* Aimed to reduce fatality to 1.8 per 100k by 2018, reduced to 1.2 instead
* Aiming for <1.0 by 2028

Steps:
* Say no to risks at work
* Engagement programme for employers to elevate awareness of WSH in new sectors
* Embracing new challenges in safety & health with WSH institute
* Definition of "reasonably practicable"
    * Capable of being done
    * Severity of any injury/harm
    * Degree of risk
    * How much is known about the hazard and ways of eliminating it
    * Availability, sustainability, cost of safeguards (Protection vs Production)

Ntu had 3 incidents regarding thermal reactors in 2014

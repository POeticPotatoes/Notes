# Maximising Customer Value
## Segmentation
**Market Segmentation** is the division of a **heterogeneous** market into distinct groups of buyers who:
* Have **distinct needs, characteristics or behaviour**
* Require separate products or **marketing mixes**

> Many of these segmentation variables are <ins> only a proxy for behaviour as they never guarantee the behaviour of consumer groups.</ins>

> It is important to practice **consistent segmentation** to provide useful analysis
## Segmentation of Customers
Customers may be segmented by various variables:

**Geographic Segmentation**:
* Country
* Regions
* City Size
* Density
* Climate

**Demographic Segmentation**:
* Age and generation
* Sex
* Family Size and Lifecycle Stage
* Income
* Occupation and Education
* Religion
* Race
* Nationality

> In the short run, Age and Generation are the same. In the long run, generation is a <ins> constant </ins> whereas age is not.

**Psychographic Segmentation**:
* Social Classes
* Lifestyles
* Personality Traits

An **example** of psychographic segmentation is the VALS (Values and Lifestyles Systems) Framework:

> Social classes are different from income due to other factors like level of education, housing, connections etc.

**Behavioural Segmentation**: A focus on whether people purhcase a product or not, how much and how often they use it
* Occasions
* Benefits Sought
* User Status
* User Rate
* Loyalty Status

> User status is related to Usage Rate in terms of identifying nonusers, exusers, low users, high users etc.

> Loyalty tends to be based on rate of repeat purchases, but might not be truly accurate due to lack of existence of substitutes.

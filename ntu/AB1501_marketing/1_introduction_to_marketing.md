## Customer Needs and Wants
**Needs** are states of **felt deprivation** such as physical, social and individual.

**Wants** are **forms** that needs take as they are shaped by culture and individual personality. 

> Marketers tend to focus on **wants** as it is easier to grasp it in the context of what they wish to sell. **However**, it is sometimes useful to consider the needs addressed by a product and how they can be better met in other ways.

**Demands** are **wants** backed by buying power.

### Catering to Customers

Marketing would usually cater to customers who are able to **demand** for a product, as a population that **wants** a product but is unable to **demand** it would not increase sales; They lack the buying power to do so.

However, it is sometimes beneficial to market to customers who might not be able to demand a product; Luxury brands often market to the masses instead of the rich as it promotes a **sense of exclusivity**, hence making it an **aspirational product**. Hence it can increase the extent that a product is able to cater to one's **social needs**; If members of the population experience an increase in buying power in the future, it is likely that they would demand the good.

This prospect of a future increase in buying power is also why companies might engage in **loss-making ventures** such as a student discount, as it will benefit the company in the long run to do so.

### Marketing Myopia
**Marketing Myopia** is the act of overfocusing on the **wants** of a customer and failing to understand their **needs**

## Customer Value and Satisfaction
More info: <ins> McKinsey Quarterly: The Three Cs of Customer Satisfaction: Consistency, Consistency, Consistency</ins>

**Marketers** need to **set the right level of expectations** with their product prices: A hefty price comes along with high expectations that a product is required to deliver, whereas a low price may convey low expectations for quality outside of the promise of basic needs or wants (utility) by the consumer.

A well-set price level could influence customers' levels of **value and satisfaction**. Customers also carry with them **personal views or perceptions** of value that a marketer would want to cater to.

Marketers aim to achieve **superior market value** even in a crowded marketplace that differentiates their product from others in the views of the customer, hence achieving **superior customer value**.

> **Cost Beyond Financial Cost**  
> **Financial cost** is the monetary cost of purchasing an item. Other costs could include effort and time required to acquire the product, or **psychological cost** in switching from one product to another.

## Company and Marketing Strategy
This course focuses on **Business unit, product and market level**.

**Marketing planning** includes more detailed strategies for specific marketing opportunities.

### Analysing A Marketing Landscape
**Marketing research** includes the analysis of:
* **Internal Data**  
    Data sources within the company network
* **Competetive Marketing Intelligence**  
    <ins> Publicly available</ins> information about the marketing environment
* **Marketing Research**  
    Data relevant to specific marketing situations

**SWOT** Analysis
||Positive|Negative|
|-|-|-|
|Internal|**Strength**<br>**Internal capabilities** that may help a company reach its objectives|**Weakness**<br> **Internal limitations** that may interfere with a company's ability to achieve its objectives|
|External|**Opportunities**<br>**External Factors** that the company may be able to exploit to its advantage|**Threats**<br>Current and emerging external factors that may **challenge** the company's performance|

> Note: An issue with this model is that <ins> strengths and weaknesses cannot be looked at in isolation</ins>; a strength could be viewed as a weakness in the context of other factors and vice versa. The same issue is present in opportunities and threats.  
>
>It is hence advisable to fill up this table as a framework for organisation instead of using it for **initial analysis**. This is because it is limiting on the variance and breadth of angles considered. It is good to keep them in mind more as **types** of factors rather than a list that should be completed.

Some companies choose to respond **dynamically** to the marketing environment by **proactively** acting on plans and **responding** accordingly to the responses or information received. (Will not be covered in this course)

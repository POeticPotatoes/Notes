# Quantitative Reasoning
Making sense of data with math and computational thinking

## Steps for quantitative reasoning
Main parts of Computational Thinking
* Framing numerical questions
* Identifying tools & data
* Building models for analysis
* Analysing results obtained

### Identifying Data
* Data Type
    * Binary, Continuous
    * In AI: Structured/Unstructured data, numeric, categorical, mixed
* Data Quantity
* Data Comparison
    * Identifying the base/control case

### Formulating Question
* Identifying which cases are **better**
* Indentifying indicators and quantifying them
    * Visualising the data
    * Idealising the distribution

> Hypo Testing (calculating std. dev of mean from std.dev of dataset): `stdDev/sqrt(n)`

#### Pearson's Correlation Coefficient
$P_{xy} = \frac{\sum{(x_i-\bar x)(y_i-\bar y)}}{\sqrt{\sigma_x\cdot\sigma_y}}$

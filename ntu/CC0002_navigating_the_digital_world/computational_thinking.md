# Computational Thinking
> IN WHICH THE COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENT MUST RELEARN HIS LITERAL DEGREE

Steps:
* Breaking down a problem
* Look for similarities
* Identify relevant information and opportunities
* Create a plan

## Components of Computational Thinking
### Abstraction
* Identifying and utilizing the structure of concepts/main ideas
* Simplifying things (Focusing on important parts instead of details)
* Manages the complexity of context/content

**Jeannette Wing**: Computational Thinking is deciding what details to highlight and what to ignore

Examples:
* Pseudocode
* Bioinformatics Applications
* Analogy of a cell (Diffusion and Crowding)
    - DNA with letters
    - Creating shapes, colours

### Algorithms
* Identifying->Creating->Following a set of **clear procedural** instructions

Examples:
* Ordering things
* Transcription & Translation
* Prediction

### Decomposition (Divide & Conquer)
* Breaking down complex data, processs or problems into smaller & more manageable components
* Each subproblem can be examined or solved individually by different **parties of analysis**
> This is a natural way to solve problems

Examples:
* Functions, Factorials
* Biological Decomposers

### Pattern Recognition
* Observing patterns, trends & regularities
* Patterns <ins>repeat in a predictable manner</ins>
* In CT, the similarities/ common differences between decomposed problems (eg. Identifying a DP or segment tree problem)

Examples:
* Machine Learning and AI pattern recognition
* Probability & Statistics
* Gene Finding/ Biomarkers

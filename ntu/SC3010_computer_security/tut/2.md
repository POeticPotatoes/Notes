### Root cause of format string vulnerability
Number of argumetns does not match number of escape sequences

* Leak unauthorised info
* Crash program
* Modify data on stack/ hijack control flow

### Prevent Integer overflow vulnerability
* Check integer boundaries
    * Sign (>0)
    * Boundary of operand (+M%M)
    * Convert to types with larger range (define int long long)

### Scripting Vulnerability
 Scripting commands are built from predefined code fragments + user input

 Script is passed to system for execution

 Attacker can hide additional commands in user input > System executes malicious command without any awareness

### Attack on C Program

add malicious format specifier, thus allowing secret on stack to be leaked

```c
// Example
printf("%08x %08x %08x %08x %08x");
```

To fix, change printf:

```c
printf("%s\n", str);
// str is no longer evaulated as a format string
```

### Webservice Issues
Buffer overflow if string exceeds $512-1-40 = 471$

Due to `fprintf`, string body can contain malicious format specifiers to view/modify stack

```
# Example 
fake-addr@ntu.edu.sg\"; rm -rf /;\"
```

### Network Buffer Reading
Data prefixed by size value

```
size = size1 + size2; // VULNERABILITY
```

Possible integer overflow if size1 and size2 are too large, resulting in buffer overflow

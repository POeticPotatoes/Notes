**Robust limitation considerations**  
From article:  
self reported dietary intake susceptible to exposure misclassification

serving definition difference

fruit juices (e.g., citrus compared with non-citrus juices) were
not compared

Observation:  
none of the included systematic reviews and
meta-analyses cited the US FDA regulatory definition of
100% fruit juice  
**BUT**
all of the included studies presented 100% fruit juice
as a stand-alone exposure category

**CONCLUSIONS:**
no associations with chronic health condi-
tions

when consumed in excess 100%
fruit juice may contribute extra dietary calories

Consumption of 100% fruit juice is associated with an
increased risk of caries in children, small increases in long-
term weight gain in young children and adults that are likely
not clinically significant in normal weight individuals, and a
decreased risk of ischemic stroke in a single individual study.

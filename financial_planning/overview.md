## Forms of business organisation
* Proprietorship: An unincorporated business owned by 1 individual
* Partnership: An unincorporated business owned by 2 or more persons
* Corporation: An incorporated business owned by many shareholders
    * Legal entity separate from owners
    * Ownership denoted by shares
    * Can be public or private

| Proprietorship & Partnership | Corporation |
|-|-|
| **Ease of formation, Subject to few regulations** | **Cost of set-up and report filing**
|| Management is more complex and hence there is a higher cost of set-up.
| **No coroporate income tax** | **Pays Double Taxation**
| Owners have only have to pay **personal income tax** | For corporations in the US, they must first pay **corporate tax** before distributing profit to owners as **dividends**. Owners then have to pay tax on their **dividend income**. <br> In Singapore, **there is no tax on most dividends** so corporations in Singapore only experience **single taxation**.
| **Difficult to raise capital** | **Easy to raise capital**
| Each partner and owner has **limited funds**. These organisations cannot raise funds by issuing **financial instruments** such as bonds and common stocks. | The company can raise capital by issuing **financial instruments** such as bonds or new common stocks.
| **Unlimited liability** |  **Limited liability** |
| **Partners and owners can lose more than what they have invested** in the company. If the business is sued or cannot pay its bills, partners and owners are **directly responsible** for the business's liabilities; They take **full responsibilities** of the business's debt | In the case of bankruptcy, shareholders (who are owners of the company) will lose **only the amount they have invested** in the **common stocks** of the company. They are not responsible for corporate debts; The **management team** will sell the company's assets to pay back debts. |
| **Limited life** | **Unlimited life, Easy Transfer of Ownership**
| Business lasts as long as the owner is still alive.| The company will stay alive as long as it is not **bankrupted** or **acquired**

## Goals of Corporation
### Stock Prices, Market Price and Intrinsic Value
|Stock Price / Market value|Intrinsic Value
|-|-|
|Short-run concept|Long-run concept: Depends on firm's future performance and cash flow
|Set by the **Marginal Investor**: the investor who makes the transaction occur.| Investors try to **estimate** the intrinsic value of a stock and my come up with different estimates, based on **best available information**.

When a stock price is less than the intrinsic value, it is **undervalued**: It is good to buy the stock.  

When a stock price is more than the intrinsic value, it is **overvalued**: It is not good to buy the stock, and you may consider selling it.  

When the stock price is equal to the intrinsic value, it is in **equillibrium**: Investors are **indifferent** between buying and selling stock.

Ideally, managers should avoid actions that reduce intrinsic value, <ins>even if those decisions increase stock price in the short run</ins>.

### Definition

Therefore, the primary financial goal of a corporation is to **maximise shareholders' wealth**, which can be translated to **maximising the intrinsic value of a stock**, which leads to **maximising the long run stock price**.

> Note: The financial goal of a corporation is not to maximise **accounting profits** as an accountant includes **non-cash items** such as **depreciation expense** are included in their calculations. Therefore it is not cash; in finance, <ins> cash is king.</ins>  
>
> Additionally, accounting profits do not take into account the **risk of cash flows** to shareholders. Most investors are **risk-averse** and do not like risk. Hence the primary financial goal of a corporation is to maximise shareholders' wealth, and not to maximise accounting profit.

> **Depreciation expense** is an accounting method of allocating the cost of a **tangible asset** over its useful life. It is used to calculate the **net book value** of an asset after it has been used for some time. It is a **non-cash item**.

## Agency Problems

**Agency Problems** are conflicts between **shareholders** and **managers**.

* Managers are naturally inclined to act in their own best interests (Which are not always the same as the interests of stockholders).

#### Solutions
* Managerial compensation packages:  
    * Reward managers based on long-run intrinsic value of the company stock.  
    * As intrinsic value is an estimate and difficult to measure, this can be gauged by the stock market price averaged over time (historical data).  
    * If the stock is performing well and is expected to continue doing well, managers get more compensation; if not, they get less compensation to ensure that managers act to increase intrinsic value of a stock.
* Direct intervention by shareholders  
    Shareholders can give suggestions or opinions on what managers should do
* Threat of firing
* The threat of takeover
